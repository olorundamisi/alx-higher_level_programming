# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

In this project, I have utilized knowledge of object-oriented programming in
Python by creating a set of 3 classes that are connected. I have used these
classes to represent rectangles and squares.
A personally formulated test suite using `unittest` to test the functionality
for each of the three classes is present.

The three classes involved make use of the following tools:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Private attributes
* Getter/setter
* Class/static methods
* Inheritance
* File I/O
* `args` & `kwargs`
* JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization
* Unittesting

## Classes :cl:

### Base

Represents the "base" class for all other classes in the project.

### Rectangle

Represents a rectangle. Inherits from `Base`.

### Square

Represents a square. Inherits from `Rectangle`.
